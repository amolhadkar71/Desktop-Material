what is journaling?
A journaling filesystem is a filesystem that maintains a special file called a journal that is used to repair any inconsistencies that occur as the result of an improper shutdown of a computer. Such shutdowns are usually due to an interruption of the power supply or to a software problem that cannot be resolved without a rebooting. 

Variations on journaling
Journaling file systems use a journal to buffer changes to the file system (which is also used in crash recovery) but can use different strategies for when and what is journaled. Three of the most common strategies are writeback, ordered, and data. 
In writeback mode, only the metadata is journaled, and the data blocks are written directly to their location on the disk. This preserves the file system structure and avoids corruption, but data corruption can occur (for example, if the system crashes after the metadata is journaled but before the data block is written). To solve this problem, you can use ordered mode. Ordered mode is metadata journaling only but writes the data before journaling the metadata. In this way, data and file system are guaranteed consistent after a recovery. Finally, data journaling can also be supported. In data mode, both metadata and data are journaled. This mode offers the greatest protection against file system corruption and data loss but can suffer from performance degradation, as all data is written twice (first to the journal, then to the disk). 
The journal commit policy can also differ in the various approaches. For example, is the journal committed when it nears full, or through a timeout?
