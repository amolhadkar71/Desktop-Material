======================================================
Types of network models:
1. Peer to peer model P2P
2. Server client model

Basics of Networking :
--------------------------
A networking consist of 2 or more computers connected toether, and they can communicate and share the resources(eg. inofrmation).

Advantages of networking:
--------------------------
Data sharing
Hardware devices sharing
Working is faster
reducess the time
 we can book ticket online
reduce the cost of organization
we can do bank trasnsaction sitting from home
voice and video chatting and conference
communication is faster
online shopping

Disadvantges of networking:

Network models:
---------------------
Peer to peer model (Workgroup model)
client server model(Domain model)

eer to peer model:
---------------------
Clients and sever are not distinguished
All the nodes are having same persmission

Advantages of peer to peer network:
low cost
simple to configure
user has full accessiblity of the computer

disadvantages:
may have duplication in resources
difficult to use security policy
difficult to handle

Client server model:
------------------------
there is a specific server and specific clients
all the clients are connected to the server
all the clients are controlled by server

Advantages of server client model or server based networks:
------------------------------------------------------------
sharing resoources
security
centralized management (users and computers)
centralized administration and control
easy to maintain the network
facility of system backup
fault tolerance

servers:
Servers are typically powerful computers that run the software that controls and maintains the network. There are some of thr servers which are user to perform a particular task:
file servers
print servers
iis web servers
proxy server:used to manage internet user
exchange servers
dhcp server
dns server
wds

Types of network:
Networks are typically classified by the amont of geographical coverage.
Local area network
Metropolitan area network
wide area network

Local area network:
a local area network is a group of systems associated in a relatively small area. It connects devices in a limited gergraphical area using or more hubs or switches.
Lan can also be interconnected withing a building.

Metropolitan area network:
MAN is the network which interconnects larger computer networks in which two or more computers are connected across a city. This network use wireless infrastracutre or optical fiber connections to link thir sites.

Imp Features :
A man typically covers an area of between 5 to 50 km diameters.
A man often acts as a high speed network to allow sharing of resources.

Wide area network:
Wide area network provides network connectivity over large geographical areas between countries. WAN consists of multiple LANs and MANs in a network over a large geographical area.

Campus area network(CAN):
A CAN or corporate area network is a network made up of an interconnection of local area networks within a limited area. A campus area network is larger than a local area network.

Some other Networks :
PAN: the samllest type of network you can currently use and the name comes from Personal area networl.

SAN: Storage Area network that connects severs to data storage devices with the use of a specific technology

DAN: Desk area network is an inteconnection of computer devices using ATM(Asynchronous Transfer Mode).

Topology
The topology of a network

It is a design of network or structure of an network

There are two basic categories of network topologies:
physical topology-how devices are connected to each other
logical topology

Physcial topology: 
defines how the nodes of the network are physically connected
It refers to the layout of cabling, the locations of nodes, and the interconnections between the nodes and the cabling.


Logical topology:
how data is transmitted between nodes
It is the way that the data passes through the network from one device to another.

Different types of topologies:
Bus,ring,star, mesh, tree and hybrid.

Bus topology:
A bus topology is multipoint.
Here one long cable act as a backbone all the devices are connected to the backbone cable.
This allows only one device to transmit at a time.
(TV DISH)
Advantages:
ease of installation.
less expensive

Disadvantages:
difficult to add new features.
If any fault in the backbone can stops all trasmission.

Ring Topology
Here each device has a dedicated connection with two devices on either side.
The signal is passed in one direction from device to device until it reaches the destination.
When one device received signals its repeater then regenerates the data and passes them along.
Advantages:
Easy to install
easy to reconfigure
